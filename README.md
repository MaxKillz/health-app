## Scraping

Used Puppeteer.js to scrape data from NIH website. Used Chrome Developer Tools to find best query selectors.

Note: Thanks, [David and MPJ from DevTips on Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pixfH6yyqZk), their Puppeteer tutorial was very useful. If you're interested in scraping large sites, then I'd highly recommend it.
